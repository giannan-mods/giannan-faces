# Giannan Faces
A state based dynamic dialog replacer for the game Odyssey of Gianna. It uses the [State Text](https://github.com/1d51/state-text) plugin.

## Features

When a party member is affected by a status, dialogues where their face is displayed will reflect this. Furthermore, the way they speak will be altered depending on said status. The following statuses currently have custom accents:

OnaHole, Relic, Succubus, Magical Girl, Golem, Petrified, Cocoon, Mega Slime, Slime, Drone, Mobile Puppet, Puppet, Zombie, Cow, Faceless, Masked II, Clown, Bimbo, Mini, Possesed, Soulfreeze, Cursed, Haigure Loop, Haigure, Stopped.
